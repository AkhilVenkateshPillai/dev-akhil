            If you are here to begin your journey to become a full-stack developer, understanding the basics of HTML
            will be your first stepping stone. Or if you are here to simply learn how to build an awesome website of
            your own, I have got your back. This could be used as an ultimate HTML cheat sheet for
            beginners.<br><br>

            Now let me answer some of the obvious questions:<br><br>

            “Do you need to have a prior knowledge of any programming languages used for web development?”<br><br>

            — NO, Not at all<br><br><br>

            “But then, Can I build a HTML page on my own?”<br><br>

            — Yes, at the end of the session you will have all the necessary tips and tricks to build your own
            website.<br><br><br>

            “Is there any requirement?”<br><br>

            — Yes, PATIENCE.<br><br><br>

            HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a language of web browsers.

            How is it different from other web development languages?<br><br>

            HTML is just a markup language that doesn’t really use any programming logic. It cannot be used for
            functional purposes such as performing mathematical operations. It is simply used to create, design and
            structure web pages.<br><br><br>

            <h3>Now let us start our journey to become a hero from zero.</h3><br><br>

            First, we need to have a HTML editor. HTML editors are nothing but just text editors where we will be
            writing our codes to build our webpage. You can always open your default text editor and start writing the
            codes. For example, the default text editor for windows is notepad. While saving the text files, instead of
            saving it with .txt extension, change the extension to .html or .htm to save it as an html document.

            <h3>Then why should you use other HTML editors?</h3> <br><br>

            HTML editors have a lot of features such as error checking, auto-completion, highlight syntaxes etc. An HTML
            editor is a precious tool irrespective of whether you are an absolute beginner or an advanced
            developer.<br><br>

            You will eventually understand why using an HTML editor makes our life easy.<br><br>

            For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using Visual Studio Code.<br><br>

            You can download it using the following link:<br><br>

            https://code.visualstudio.com/download<br><br>

            <h3>Once you set up the HTML editor, Let us begin.</h3><br><br>

            Let us first try to understand the structure of a basic html code. Lets carefully examine the HTML code
            shown below. You could see several words enclosed within < and>. Those are called tags. Tags are used to
                structure and organize contents in a HTML document.<br><br>



                <pre class="project-container">

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Page Title&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
&lt;h1&gt;My First Heading&lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;My first paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
                
                    </pre>


                <p>Feel free to copy the chunk of code and paste it in your editor.
                    Save it and open the document in a web browser to see what we just did there. <br><br>
                    Let’s look at some basic tags:

                <h3>Tags. Why do we use it?</h3>

                <img class="container" src="/blog_content/images/Screenshot (2).png" alt=""> <br><br>

                It is important to note that every tag has two components, an opening tag and a closing tag. For
                example, to define the body of a html document we will use an opening tag <br><br>

                < body> and a closing tag </ body>. Every content will be enclosed within them.
                Let’s explore the heading tag now:
                Try these codes and observe what it does. <br><br></p>


                <pre class="project-container">
&lt;h1&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Heading 4&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Heading 5&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h6&gt;Heading 6&lt;/h6&gt;
                    </pre>



                As you can see, you can use different tags to define different sizes for your headings. Now, if you
                aren’t happy with the basic 6 sizes, you could always customize it. Let’s see how you do it: <br><br>

                <pre class="project-container">
&lt;h1 style=&quot;font-size:70px;&quot;&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;
                </pre>

                We just customized the font size by using a ‘style’ attribute. Similarly, we can customize the font
                style, colour and several other features. <br>
                Lets try changing the font style, colour and give our heading a center alignment: <br><br>

                <pre class="project-container">
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size:70px; color:red&quot;&gt; Red Heading &lt;/h1&gt;
                </pre>

                Now let us move on to next tag,
                The < p> tag <br>
                    Let us try the following: <br>

                    <pre class="project-container">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Our Page&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size:30px; color:red&quot;&gt; Red Heading &lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next
to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately
625&ndash;740 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and 
the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from
the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson,
and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
                                    </pre>


                    Did you just see what happened?
                    We just created a basic page where we are talking about the colour red.
                    It looks like a big chunk of information under a heading. Lets try beautifying it. <br><br>
                    Let’s break the content into multiple lines. We will be using the < br> tag, this is one of those
                    rare tags that do not require a closing tag. <br><br>

                    <pre class="project-container">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; 
&lt;html&gt; 
&lt;head&gt; 
&lt;title&gt;Our Page&lt;/title&gt; 
&lt;/head&gt; 
&lt;body&gt; 
&lt;h1 style=&quot;text-align:center; font-size:30px; color:red&quot;&gt; Red Heading &lt;/h1&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Red is the color at the end of the visible spectrum of light, next
to orange and opposite violet. &lt;br&gt; 
It has a dominant wavelength of approximately625&ndash;740 nanometres. &lt;br&gt;
It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the CMYK color model.&lt;br&gt;
Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to red crimson,
and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
                                                            </pre>
